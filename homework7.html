                    <p>
                        <img src="images/HW7/graph.jpg" alt="Simulation Graphs" width="1200" />
                        <br>
                    <h3>Observed Behaviour</h3>
                    <p>In this new simulation, the approach taken generates 1000 samples (m) with sizes (n) 20, 30 and
                        100, calculating the empirical mean and variance for each group.</p>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Central Limit Theorem (CLT)</h3>
                    <p>
                        What we can see is that with \(n\) sufficiently large, the distribution of the computed mean for
                        each sample
                        will approximate a normal distribution, regardless of the shape of the original distribution, as
                        the CLT states
                        (given an initial distribution with finite mean \(\mu\) and finite variance \(\sigma^2\)).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The mean of the distribution of sample means is approximately equal to the mean of the
                        theoretical distribution,
                        \(\mu\), whereas the variance of the sample means should be approximately
                        \(\frac{\sigma^2}{n}\), where
                        \(\sigma^2\) is the variance of the original distribution.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So the simulation confirms that the mean of the empirical means tends to the theoretical mean
                        (calculated as a weighted average of the possible values according to their probability). With
                        small sample sizes (e.g., size 20), the variance of the empirical means is more evident, but
                        decreases significantly as the number of \(n\) increases, following the relationship
                        \(\frac{\sigma^2}{n}\).
                    </p>

                    <h3>Sample Dimension Effects</h3>
                    <p>
                        Larger samples (e.g. size 100) show faster and more stable convergence than
                        than smaller samples (e.g. size 20).
                        This confirms the importance of sample size in reducing statistical fluctuations.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>
                        This simulation highlights the link between sample size, precision of estimates and
                        convergence of empirical statistics to theoretical ones. The graphs show how, by increasing the
                        samples size, the empirical values approach the theoretical ones, with a reduction in the
                        variability of the samples means. This behavior aligns with the Central Limit Theorem, which
                        guarantees that the distribution of sample means approximates a normal distribution for
                        sufficiently large samples.

                    <h3>Shape of the Distributions</h3>
                    <p>
                        Plots are generated using \( n = 19 \) and \( g = \{2, 3, 10, 17\} \) (Case A), and \( n = 15 \)
                        and \( g = \{3, 6, 9, 12\} \) (Case B).
                    </p>
                    <h3>Entropy</h3>
                    <p>
                        Once the program is run, we'll see the entropy values printed for each combination of \( n \)
                        and \( g \).
                        <img src="images/HW7/entropy.png" alt="Entropy"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here's how the results are to be interpreted:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Case A:</strong>
                        <br>
                        \( n = 19, g = \{2, 3, 10, 17\} \)
                        <br>
                        Since \( 19 \) is a prime number, the values of \( g \) that are coprime with \( 19 \) (\( 2, 3,
                        10, 17 \)) will generate more uniform distributions. These values of \( g \) will cover the
                        entire range of \([0, 18]\), and thus, the distribution should be more uniform.
                        We expect higher entropy values (close to \( \log_2(19) \approx 4.25 \)).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Case B:</strong>
                        <br>
                        \( n = 15, g = \{3, 6, 9, 12\} \)
                        <br>
                        \( 15 \) is not prime, and some of the values of \( g \) (\( 9 \) and \( 12 \)) are divisible by
                        factors of \( 15 \) (\( 3, 5 \)), which will lead to repeated values in the distribution. This
                        will result in lower entropy compared to Case A, since the values of \( Y \) will be
                        concentrated in fewer numbers (lower diversity).
                    </p>
                    <h3>Comparison and Cryptographic Implications</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Uniformity:</strong>
                        <br>
                        A uniform distribution means \( Y \) is unpredictable, making it ideal for cryptographic keys or
                        random numbers.
                        For \( n = 19 \) and \( g \in \{2, 3, 10, 17\} \), the resulting values of \( Y \) are likely to
                        be more evenly distributed.
                        This uniformity provides higher entropy and better resistance to cryptanalysis attacks.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Higher Entropy:</strong>
                        <br>
                        Case A, with \( n = 19 \) and coprime values of \( g \), generates distributions where the
                        values of \( Y \) are more evenly spread across the range. This makes it harder for an attacker
                        to predict the values.
                        <br>
                        Why does Case B illustrate vulnerabilities?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Lower Entropy:</strong>
                        <br>
                        For \( n = 15 \) (non-prime modulus), the behavior of \( g \) depends heavily on its factors.
                        \( g = 9 \) and \( g = 12 \) are not coprime with \( n = 15 \), leading to repeated patterns in
                        \( Y \).
                        Such patterns reduce unpredictability, which lowers entropy and increases susceptibility to
                        attacks.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Predictability:</strong>
                        <br>
                        Non-uniform or incomplete distributions make \( Y \) predictable, which is dangerous in
                        cryptographic applications.
                        If an attacker knows \( g \), \( n \), and the reduced range of \( Y \), they can guess keys or
                        plaintexts more effectively.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Possible Errors in the Exercise</h3>
                    <p>
                        Choice of \( g \) in Case B:
                        <br>
                        \( g = 9 \) and \( g = 12 \) are not valid generators modulo \( 15 \) (they are divisible by \(
                        3 \)).
                        Better choices would be \( g = \{2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14\} \), which are coprime with \( n = 15
                        \).
                    </p>
