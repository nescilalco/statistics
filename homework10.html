                    <h2>Sampling Mean and Variance</h2>

                    <h3>Sampling Mean (\( \bar{X} \))</h3>
                    <p>
                        The sampling mean is the average of \( n \) observations from a population.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Its main properties are:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Unbiasedness:</strong> The expected value of the sampling mean equals the population
                            mean (\( \mu
                            \)):
                            \[
                            E[\bar{X}] = \mu
                            \]
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Variance:</strong> The variance of the sampling mean decreases with the sample size
                            \( n \):
                            \[
                            \text{Var}(\bar{X}) = \frac{\sigma^2}{n}
                            \]
                            where \( \sigma^2 \) is the variance of the population.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Distribution (Central Limit Theorem): </strong> For sufficiently large \( n \), the
                            distribution of \( \bar{X} \) approximates a normal
                            distribution, even if the population distribution is not normal:
                            \[
                            \bar{X} \sim N\left(\mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{n}\right)
                            \]
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>


                    <h3>Sampling Variance (\( S^2 \))</h3>
                    <p>
                        The sampling variance is an estimate of the population variance based on the sample.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The main properties are:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Unbiasedness:</strong> The expected value of the sample variance equals the
                            population variance:
                            \[
                            E[S^2] = \sigma^2
                            \]
                            where, for a sample of size \( n \), the sample variance is computed as:
                            \[
                            S^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \bar{X})^2
                            \]
                            The divisor \( n-1 \) (instead of \( n \)) ensures the unbiasedness of the estimate.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Variance:</strong>
                            <p>
                                The variance of the sampling variance quantifies how much the sample variance (
                                \(
                                S^2
                                \)
                                ) fluctuates across different samples of the same size, taken from the same population.
                                For a normal distribution, the variance of the sample variance can be expressed as:
                            </p>
                            <p style="text-align: center;">
                                \[
                                \text{Var}(S^2) = \frac{2\sigma^4}{n-1}
                                \]
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>


                    <h3>Relationship Between Sampling Mean and Variance</h3>
                    <p>
                        The sampling mean and variance are related, but they measure different aspects of the data:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The sampling mean quantifies the central tendency.</li>
                        <li>The sampling variance quantifies the spread of the data around the mean.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Independence (Normal Populations):</h4>
                    <p>
                        For normally distributed populations, the sample mean and sample variance are independent.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        These properties ensure that the sampling mean and variance provide accurate and reliable
                        estimates of the population parameters when the sample size is sufficiently large.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Lebesgue–Stieltjes Integration</h2>
                    <p>
                        The <strong>Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral</strong> generalizes the classical Riemann integral to
                        handle cases where
                        the integration process is influenced by a non-decreasing function \( F(x) \).
                        This integration method is useful when \( F(x) \) has jumps,
                        discontinuities,
                        or a non-uniform growth.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Unlike the Riemann integral, which divides the domain into equal intervals, the
                        Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral
                        considers the cumulative changes in \( F(x) \). These changes may include discrete jumps, which
                        correspond to
                        concentrated measures. The function \( F(x) \) determines how much "weight" each part of the
                        domain contributes
                        to the integral.
                    </p>

                    <p>A function has discontinuities if it contains jumps, that represent point masses like these:</p>
                    <p>
                        \[
                        F(x) =
                        \begin{cases}
                        0 & \text{if } x < 0, \\ 0.5 & \text{if } 0 \leq x < 1, \\ 1 & \text{if } x \geq 1. \end{cases}
                            \] </p>
                            <p>
                                Also, the function \( F(x) \) can assign different weights to different regions of the
                                integration, so some parts of the domain contribute more to the integral than others.
                            </p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The integral of a function \( f(x) \) with respect to \( F(x) \) is denoted as:</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">\[
                        \int_a^b f(x) \, dF(x)
                        \]</p>
                    <p>
                        where \( dF(x) \) incorporates information about the changes in \( F(x) \).
                    </p>


                    <h2>Applications to Probability Theory</h2>
                    <p>
                        In probability theory, \( F(x) \) often represents a cumulative distribution function (CDF). The
                        Lebesgue–Stieltjes
                        integral is used to calculate expectations, variances, and other moments for random variables.
                        For a random
                        variable \( X \) with a CDF \( F(x) \), the expectation is given by:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        \[
                        \mathbb{E}[X] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x \, dF(x).
                        \]
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This method handles discrete, continuous, or mixed distributions. For example:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Probability Mass Concentrations:</strong> If \( F(x) \) has jumps, the integral
                            accounts for point probabilities, as in the case of discrete random variables.</li>
                        <li><strong>Non-Uniform Distributions:</strong> \( F(x) \) can assign different weights to
                            various regions of the domain, enabling integration in cases where probabilities are
                            unevenly distributed.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Applications to Measure Theory</h2>
                    <p>
                        In measure theory, the Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral is the base for integrating with respect to a
                        measure \( \mu \). Here, \( F(x) \) defines a measure, and the integral adapts accordingly. Some
                        applications include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Integration with Respect to a Measure:</strong> The integral is used for lengths,
                            areas, probabilities, or other generalized "sizes."</li>
                        <li><strong>Radon–Nikodym Derivative:</strong> It is essential for expressing one measure in
                            terms of another.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mixed Measures:</strong> The integral handles distributions with both discrete and
                            continuous parts naturally.</li>

        <h2 class="major">Simulation Exercise</h2>
        <h3>Part 1</h3>
        <p>
            In this simulation, we compared Riemann and Lebesgue integrals for 4 different continuous functions and for
            a maximum
            number of subdivision equal to 500.
        </p>
        <p>
            The two integrations offer distinct ways of calculating and interpreting an area under a curve. Computing a
            Lebesgue integral numerically can be done by summing contributions of function values over measure-based
            partitions (e.g., intervals grouped by function values), whereas the Riemann integral approximates the area
            under a curve by partitioning the domain into small intervals. That's what we did in the following code:
        </p>

        <img src="images/HW10/SimulateDistribution.png" alt="Simulate Distribution" />

        <p>Selecting one of the 4 factions using the radio button and clicking "Simulate" button, the
            <code>SimulateDistribution</code> function is triggered. Here we define the integration bounds and the
            maximum number of subdivisions. The integration bounds chosen is [0,1], as the interval \([0, 1]\) is a
            standard choice in mathematical analysis, avoids significant
            divergences, and provides a uniform
            domain for comparing the four functions.
        </p>

        <p>
            For each increasing subdivision we compute the Riemann and Lebesgue
            using the two separate methods, plotting the result in the scatter plot.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>
            Then we compute the mean and variance of the selected function, showing the result in the console.
        </p>

        <h3>Part 2</h3>
        <p>
            The <strong>"Optional Simulation"</strong> button triggers the <code>BtnSimulate_optional_Click</code>
            method, which calls the <code>SubstitutionCipher</code> method.
            <hr>
            <img src="images/HW9/SubstitutionCipher.png" alt="SubstitutionCipher" />
            <br>
            The method starts by analyzing the plain message "I AM NESCILALCO". The <code>AnalyzeFrequency</code>
            function calculates the
            frequency distribution of its characters, showing how often each character appears. The most
            frequent letters here are "I", "A", and "L", since "I" appears twice, "A" appears twice, etc..
            <br>
            This distribution is then used to compute Shannon entropy through the <code>CalculateShannonEntropy</code>
            function.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next, the method applies a substitution cipher to encrypt the message. The cipher uses a substitutionKey to
            map each character to another (unique), obscuring the original content.
            <br>
            Once encrypted, the frequency distribution of the message is analyzed again.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, the method reverses the encrypted message and analyses it again.

        <h4>Impact of Substitution Cipher on the Distribution</h4>
        <p>
            In the original message, the way letters are distributed shows the typical patterns of the language used.
            This natural distribution gives clues about the language and structure of the message before any
            encryption is applied.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the message is encrypted using a substitution cipher, each letter in the original message is replaced
            with a different letter based on a random key. This means the original letters are swapped for new ones,
            following a specific mapping decided by the key. For instance, if "E" was the most frequent letter in the
            original message,
            after substitution, it might be mapped to a completely different letter ("B", for example). Similarly, "B"
            in the
            original message could become "S", and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
            The result is that the familiar frequency patterns of the language
            disappear. Instead, the frequency of the letters is "randomized", making it
            harder for an hypothetical attacker to guess the original message just by
            analyzing the frequencies of the letters.
        </p>

        <p>
            We can see in the graph that in the case of a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, frequency distribution and
            entropy do not change compared to the original text. Each letter of the original message is replaced by a
            single
            letter, but the relative frequency of each letter does not change.
            <br>
            Therefore, the frequency distribution of each letter in the encrypted message will be identical to that of
            the original message, simply with an alteration of the letters (for example, the letter "A" could become
            "X", but the frequency of "A" in the encrypted message will be the same as that of "X" in the original
            message).
        </p>
        <h4>Entropy</h4>
        <p>
            The entropy of a message measures the amount of uncertainty or "randomness" in the probabilities of
            occurrence of symbols in the message. In the case of a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, the entropy of
            the ciphered message will be the same as that of the original message, because the probabilities of
            occurrence of the letters do not change.
        </p>
        <p>
            If, on the other hand, I used a polyalphabetic substitution cipher (such as the Vigenère cipher) or a block
            cipher (such as AES), the effect would be different. The frequency distribution would be altered, as in
            these ciphers the letters are replaced in a more complex way, taking more variables into account. Entropy
            would increase, because in a more complex cipher each letter would be less predictable and the frequency
            distribution would be more uniform.
        </p>
        <h4>Reverse</h4>
        <p>
            Reversing the encrypted message does not change the letter frequencies or entropy in terms of distribution,
            as discussed previously. The frequencies and entropy will remain the same, but the order of the letters will
            be different.
        </p>
        <p>
            Reversing the message does not introduce additional randomness, though it might obscure the structure and
            patterns related to the position of the letters in the message.
