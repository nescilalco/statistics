                    <h2>Median</h2>
                    <p>The <strong>median</strong> of a data set is the value that divides the data into two equal
                        halves when the
                        numbers are arranged in order. If there is an odd number of data points, the median is the
                        middle value. If there is an even number of data points, the median is the average of the two
                        middle values.</p>

                    <!--<strong>Example:</strong>
                    <p>For the data set \( [1, 3, 5, 7, 9] \), the median is <strong>5</strong> (the middle value).</p>
                    <p>For the data set \( [1, 3, 7, 9] \), the median is \( \frac{3 + 7}{2} = 5 \).</p>-->

                    <h2>Absolute Deviation and Minimization</h2>
                    <!-- <p>In statistics, <strong>absolute deviation</strong> refers to the absolute difference between each
                        data point and a
                        central point, typically the mean or median of the data set. It is a measure used to assess the
                        variability or spread of data values in relation to a specific point.</p>

                    <p>
                        The formula for calculating the absolute deviation of a set of values \( x_1, x_2, ..., x_n \)
                        from a central point \( c \) is:
                    </p>

                    <div class="formula">
                        <p>
                            \( f(c) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - c| \)
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Here:
                    <ul>
                        <li>\( x_i \) represents each individual value in the dataset, where \( i \) is the index
                            ranging from 1 to \( n \).</li>
                        <li>\( c \) is the central point, which could be the mean, median, or another value of interest.
                        </li>
                        <li>\( |x_i - c| \) denotes the absolute value of the difference between each data point \( x_i
                            \) and the central point \( c \).</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p> -->

                    <p>The absolute deviation is the sum of the absolute differences between each data point \( x_1,
                        x_2,
                        \dots, x_n \) and a central point \( c \):</p>

                    <p>\[
                        f(c) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - c|
                        \]</p>

                    <p>To understand why the median minimizes this function, let’s break it down step by step:</p>

                    <h3>Absolute Deviation and Distance</h3>

                    <p>The absolute deviation measures the total "distance" between each point in the dataset and the
                        chosen central value \( c \). The goal is to find the \( c \) that minimizes this total
                        distance. Unlike squared differences (used in variance), absolute differences don’t exaggerate
                        larger deviations, which makes this method less sensitive to outliers.</p>

                    <h3>Behavior of \( f(c) \)</h3>

                    <p>If you were to move \( c \) either left or right from a central position (e.g., the median), the
                        sum of absolute deviations would either increase or decrease depending on the number of points
                        on either side of \( c \). </p>

                    <p>If \( c \) is to the left of the median, there are more points on the right, and moving \( c \)
                        slightly to the right will reduce the absolute deviations from these points. Similarly, if \( c
                        \) is to the right of the median, there are more points on the left, and moving \( c \) to the
                        left will reduce the absolute deviations from the points on the left.</p>

                    <p>Thus, the total deviation will be minimized when \( c \) is positioned such that the number of
                        points to the left and right of \( c \) are balanced—this occurs at the median.</p>

                    <h3>The Median as the Minimizer</h3>

                    <ul>
                        <li>For an odd number of data points, the median is the middle value, so the number of points on
                            either side of \( c \) is equal. Moving \( c \) in either direction from this point will
                            increase the sum of absolute deviations.</li>
                        <li>For an even number of data points, the median is typically defined as the average of the two
                            middle values. Again, this point ensures that the total deviation is minimized because the
                            number of points on either side is balanced.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>In other words, the median is the point at which the sum of the distances between each data point
                        and \( c \) is minimized because it splits the dataset into two equal halves, balancing the
                        deviations on both sides.</p>

                    <h3>Visual Intuition</h3>

                    <p>Imagine lining up all data points on a number line. If you place \( c \) at any value other than
                        the median, you’ll notice that the sum of the absolute distances from the points on one side
                        will outweigh the distances on the other. Only at the median are these distances balanced, which
                        minimizes the total absolute deviation.</p>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>

                    <p>Thus, the median is the value of \( c \) that minimizes the total absolute deviation, because it
                        divides the data into two equal halves, making the deviations from the central point as small as
                        possible on both sides. This property makes the median a robust and effective measure of central
                        tendency when minimizing total deviation is important.</p>

                    <h2>Formal Proof</h2>

                    <p>Consider the Ordered Data:</p>
                    <p>\[
                        x_1 \leq x_2 \leq \dots \leq x_n
                        \]</p>

                    <p>Define \( m \) as the median of the data set. For simplicity, assume \( n \) is odd, so the
                        median is:</p>
                    <p>\[
                        m = x_{\frac{n+1}{2}}
                        \]</p>

                    <h3>Derivative Analysis</h3>
                    <p>To minimize the sum</p>
                    <p>\[
                        f(c) = \sum |x_i - c|
                        \]</p>
                    <p>we examine how the function behaves as \( c \) changes. The absolute value function \( |x_i - c|
                        \) behaves differently depending on whether \( c \) is greater than, less than, or equal to each
                        \( x_i \).</p>

                    <p>Define the left and right derivatives of \( f(c) \):</p>
                    <p>For \( c < x_i \), \( |x_i - c|=x_i - c \).</p>
                            <p>For \( c > x_i \), \( |x_i - c| = c - x_i \).</p>

                            <p>Summing over all data points, the derivative of \( f(c) \) with respect to \( c \) is:
                            </p>
                            <p>\[
                                f'(c) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{sign}(x_i - c)
                                \]</p>

                            <p>where \( \text{sign}(x_i - c) \) is +1 if \( c < x_i \), -1 if \( c> x_i \), and 0 if \(
                                    c = x_i \).</p>

                            <h3>The median</h3>
                            <p>At the median \( m \), there are an equal number of data points on either side:</p>
                            <p>For \( c = m \), half of the data points are less than or equal to \( m \) and half are
                                greater than or equal to \( m \).</p>

                            <p>The sum of signs for data points below the median cancels out with the sum of signs for
                                data points above the median:</p>
                            <p>\[
                                f'(m) = 0
                                \]</p>

                            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                            <p>Therefore, the median is the value of \( c \) where the sum of absolute deviations
                                reaches a minimum. Moving \( c \) to either side of the median increases the sum of
                                deviations because there will be more points farther away, leading to a larger total
                                distance.</p>

                    <p>A "location" in statistics is also called "central tendency" and can be seen as a
                        synthesis
                        of a statistical distribution, as it "summarizes" or "condenses" the information
                        provided by
                        a distribution. It's fundamental to reduce the complexity of a dataset, and does it by
                        extracting key characteristics. This type of statistic aims to identify a value that
                        represents some sort of "center" or "summary" of the data.</p>

                            <strong>Geometric mean:</strong> used for proportional data (like growth rates), as

                        <h3>Observations</h3>
                        <p>The generalization of "location" statistics or central tendency measures can potentially lead
                            to
                            infinite other definitions, because each method of summarizing the center or typical value
                            of a
                            data set relies on specific assumptions, goals, and interpretations of the data.</p>
                        <p>Many central tendency measures, like the <strong>Weighted mean</strong>, rely on applying
                            different weights to the data points. We could define new
                            types of means by varying how the weights are applied, for example by giving more emphasis
                            to recent values in a time series, or on how far they are from some reference point.</p>
                        <p>Central tendency measures often differ in how they treat extreme values (outliers),
                            <strong>Trimmed mean</strong>, for example, ignores a portion of highest and lowest values.
                            We could create new measures by developing custom rules for dealing with outliers, such as
                            progressive trimming, weighting outliers less, or defining outlier boundaries dynamically.
                        </p>
                        <p>Central tendency can also be defined based on certain functions of the data,
                            <strong>Mode</strong>, for example, is based on the frequency of values. We could define new
                            means based on different mathematical functions, by doing this there are
                            theoretically infinite ways to define new measures.
                        </p>
                        <p>The idea of central tendency can be changed and expanded in many ways and with different
                            methods, and each method shows a different way of looking at what matters in a set of data.
                            This makes central tendency a flexible concept, allowing for new ideas and definitions based
                            on the data or situation. Because of this, there’s no limit to how we can define a "center"
                            in statistics.</p>

        <h2 class="major">Attack Simulation Exercise</h2>
        <p>This code implements a simulation of cyber attacks, where the cumulative number of successful penetrations by
            a certain number of attackers (defined by the user) is tracked over a time interval, tending to infinite and
            divided into very small
            subintervals. The graphical output shows the temporal evolution of the attacks as time progresses and
            visualizes the trajectories of each attacker.
        </p>

        <h3>Input Fields and User Interface</h3>
        <p>The form contains three input fields to take values for time (<code>n</code>), number of attackers
            (<code>m</code>), and the attack rate (<code>lambda</code>).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Time (t)</strong> represents the number of time intervals and it should be very big.</li>
            <li><strong>Number of Attackers (m)</strong> representing the number of entities trying to penetrate the
                system.</li>
            <li><strong>Rate of Attacks (lambda)</strong> defines the probability of
                success for each small time interval.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Simulation Logic</h3>
        <p>The <code>SimulatePenetration()</code> function is where the core of the simulation takes place. Here's how
            it works:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Initialization:</strong> A <code>Bitmap</code> object is created to visualize the results, and a
                random number generator is initialized for probabilistic simulations.</li>
            <li><strong>Time Step Size:</strong> The time window is divided into <code>n</code> small intervals, with
                each interval having a size <code>dt = 1/n</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Probability of Attack Success:</strong> For each small interval, the probability of a successful
                attack is <code>lambda_dt = lambda * dt</code>. This reflects the continuous-time approximation
                requested by the professor.</li>
            <li><strong>Simulating Attacks:</strong> For each attacker, the program simulates whether an attack is
                successful at each time step. If the random number generated is less than <code>lambda_dt</code>, the
                attacker is successful, and the cumulative success count is incremented.</li>
        </ul>
