                    <h3>Median</h3>
                    <p>The <strong>median</strong> of a data set is the value that divides the data into two equal
                        halves when the
                        numbers are arranged in order. If there is an odd number of data points, the median is the
                        middle value. If there is an even number of data points, the median is the average of the two
                        middle values.</p>

                    <strong>Example:</strong>
                    <p>For the data set \( [1, 3, 5, 7, 9] \), the median is <strong>5</strong> (the middle value).</p>
                    <p>For the data set \( [1, 3, 7, 9] \), the median is \( \frac{3 + 7}{2} = 5 \).</p>

                    <h3>Absolute Deviation</h3>
                    <p>In statistics, <strong>absolute deviation</strong> refers to the absolute difference between each data point and a
                        central point, typically the mean or median of the data set. It is a measure used to assess the
                        variability or spread of data values in relation to a specific point.</p>

                        <p>
                            The formula for calculating the absolute deviation of a set of values \( x_1, x_2, ..., x_n \) from a central point \( c \) is:
                        </p>
                    
                        <p>
                            \( f(c) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - c| \)

                                <li>\( x_i \) represents each individual value in the dataset, where \( i \) is the index ranging from 1 to \( n \).</li>
                                <li>\( c \) is the central point, which could be the mean, median, or another value of interest.</li>
                                <li>\( |x_i - c| \) denotes the absolute value of the difference between each data point \( x_i \) and the central point \( c \).</li>

                    <h2 class="major">Computational Problems with Floating Point Representation</h2>
                    <p>Computers store and manipulate numbers using a system called floating-point representation, which
                        allows them to handle a wide range of numbers despite hardware limitations. It’s called
                        "floating-point" because the decimal (or binary) point "floats" depending on the size of the
                        number being represented. Floating-point numbers are expressed in a scientific notation form,
                        but in base-2 (binary), instead of base-10 (decimal).</p>

                    <p>The number is written as:</p>
                    <p>$$x = s \times m \times 2^e$$</p>

                    <p>Where:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>s</strong> is the sign bit (0 for positive, 1 for negative),</li>
                        <li><strong>m</strong> is the mantissa or significand (which contains the precision of the
                            number),</li>
                        <li><strong>e</strong> is the exponent, determining how large or small the number is by
                            adjusting its scale (the number of powers of 2 to multiply by).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>However, floating-point arithmetic isn’t perfect, and can lead to computational errors:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The mantissa can only store a fixed number of digits, and some numbers cannot be represented
                            exactly, leading to rounding errors. As most floating-point numbers are only approximations,
                            most of the problems arise in long chains of computations, where these small errors can
                            accumulate.</li>
                        <li><strong>Catastrophic cancellation</strong> is a significant loss of precision that occurs
                            when subtracting two nearly equal numbers. The subtraction causes the most significant
                            digits (the leading digits) to cancel out, leaving behind only the smaller and less accurate
                            trailing digits, resulting in a loss of meaningful precision.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The renowned American computer scientist and mathematician Donald Knuth proposed various
                        solutions to these problems in his work "The Art of Computer Programming", among them:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Compensated Summation Techniques:</strong> These techniques involve tracking small
                            errors during summation processes using a compensating variable that accounts for the error
                            in each step of the summation. This helps maintain accuracy in the results.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reformulating Expressions:</strong> This approach aims to find algebraic
                            transformations that reduce or eliminate the need to subtract nearly equal numbers. For
                            example, $$a^2 - b^2$$ can be reformulated as $$(a - b) \times (a + b)$$ to avoid direct
                            subtraction.</li>
                        <li><strong>Using higher precision:</strong> This method consists of using higher precision
                            arithmetic when possible, particularly when dealing with operations that are prone to
                            significant cancellation. For example, switching from single-precision (32-bit) to
                            double-precision (64-bit) or even higher precision can mitigate some of the effects of
                            floating-point errors, though it won't eliminate them entirely.</li>
