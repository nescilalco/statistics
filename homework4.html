                    <h2>Statistical Independence</h2>
                    <p>Statistical independence describes situations where the occurrence of one event does not
                        influence the probability of another. This concept is central in analyzing relationships between
                        variables or events.</p>

                    <h3>Formal Definition of Independence</h3>
                    <p>For two events <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> to be <strong>independent</strong>, the probability of both
                        <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> occurring together (denoted as \( P(A \cap B) \)) must equal the product
                        of their individual probabilities:
                    </p>
                    <p class="formula">\[
                        P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)
                        \]</p>
                    <p>If this condition holds, then knowing that <i>A</i> has occurred tells us nothing about the
                        likelihood of <i>B</i>, and vice versa.</p>

                    <h3>Example with Events</h3>
                    <p>Suppose we roll two dice. Let:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>A</strong>: the event that the first die shows a 4.</li>
                        <li><strong>B</strong>: the event that the second die shows a 6.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Since the outcome of one die does not affect the other, these events are independent. The
                        probability of \( A \cap B \) (first die shows 4 and second die shows 6) is:</p>
                    <p class="formula">\[
                        P(A) = \frac{1}{6}, \quad P(B) = \frac{1}{6}, \quad P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B) = \frac{1}{6}
                        \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{36}
                        \]</p>
                    <p>Because \( P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B) \), <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are independent.</p>


                    <h3>Analogy with Conditional Probability</h3>
                    <p>Another way to express independence is through conditional probability: if <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>
                        are independent, then:</p>
                    <p class="formula">\[
                        P(A | B) = P(A) \quad \text{and} \quad P(B | A) = P(B)
                        \]</p>
                    <p>This means that knowing <i>B</i> has occurred does not change the probability of <i>A</i>, and
                        vice versa.</p>

                    <h3>Statistical Independence for Random Variables</h3>
                    <p>Two random variables <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> are independent if, for any values <i>x</i> and
                        <i>y</i>, the probability of \( X = x \) and \( Y = y \) occurring together is the product of
                        their individual probabilities:
                    </p>
                    <p class="formula">\[
                        P(X = x \text{ and } Y = y) = P(X = x) \cdot P(Y = y)
                        \]</p>
                    <p>Example: If <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> represent the results of two independent coin tosses (heads =
                        1, tails = 0), then:</p>
                    <p class="formula">\[
                        P(X = 1 \text{ and } Y = 1) = P(X = 1) \cdot P(Y = 1) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} =
                        \frac{1}{4}
                        \]</p>

        <h2 class="major">Attack Simulation Exercise</h2>
        <h2>Refining the Stochastic SDE Simulator for Continuous Time</h2>
        <p>This new code simulates a continuous random walk process by dividing time into small intervals (∆t) and using
            a
            defined probability at each step to approximate Brownian motion. Each attacker (hacker) performs a series of
            <em>n</em> steps on a graphical "field," allowing us to observe how the discrete random walk approximates a
            continuous Wiener process, or Brownian motion. This simulation comply to the Donsker Invariance Principle,
            which states that a sufficiently rescaled random walk process will tend towards Brownian motion.
        </p>

        <h3>Continuous Approximation in the SDE Simulation</h3>
        <p>To approximate continuous time, the temporal window is divided into very small <em>n</em> intervals, each
            represented by ∆t = 1/n. At each interval:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>With a probability <code>p</code>, the process takes a step up by <code>+√dt</code>.</li>
            <li>With probability <code>1 - p</code>, it steps down by <code>-√dt</code>.</li>
            <li>The final position of each attacker after <em>n</em> steps is stored in the <code>successCounts</code>
                array, where each continuous position is rounded to a discrete "success" value.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <img src="images/HW4/sim_graph.png" alt="Simulation Graph" width="1500" />
        <br>

        <h3>Donsker Invariance Principle and Transition to Brownian Motion</h3>
        <p>
            The Donsker Invariance Principle, also known as the Functional Central Limit Theorem, underpins this process
            by explaining how the discrete random walk model transitions into Brownian Motion as the intervals
            <em>dt</em> become infinitesimally small and the number of steps grows. This principle establishes that a
            sufficiently rescaled random walk converges to a Wiener Process (Brownian Motion), a phenomenon
            characterized by independent and stationary increments &mdash; both essential features of the Wiener
            Process.
        </p>

        <h3>Brownian Motion in the Simulation</h3>
        <p>In the context of this simulation, Brownian Motion describes the result of this refined process, with key
            properties that reflect real-world random fluctuations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Continuous Paths:</strong> Each path evolves without jumps, and each position depends on an
                accumulation of tiny, random changes.</li>
            <li><strong>Mean and Variance:</strong> The expected change over time remains zero, while variance grows
                linearly with time. This corresponds to the scaled random walk, where steps fluctuate by
                <em>&pm;&radic;dt</em> in both directions to align with continuous Brownian dynamics.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Brownian Motion is widely used to model random fluctuations in fields like physics and finance, representing
            random yet continuous changes over time. By scaling each step by <em>&radic;dt</em> in this simulation, the
            model approximates Brownian Motion effectively, providing valuable insights into systems that exhibit
            random, continuous behaviors.
        </p>

        <p>
            This simulator highlights its potential for modeling stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Through
            continuous approximations of random processes, it provides a realistic framework for simulating complex,
            real-world systems where fluctuations evolve over time in a continuous, unpredictable manner.
        </p>

        <p>The process assigns the direction of the step (positive or negative) randomly and uniformly, with no specific
            bias toward one direction. This ensures the simulation remains symmetrical, with no tendency toward positive
            or negative values, replicating the Brownian motion property of oscillating around zero with random
            deviations over time.</p>

        <p>The choice of step size Δt√Δt ensures that over a sufficiently long period, the total variance grows
            proportionally to time, as in a Wiener process or Brownian motion.</p>
        <p>In short, the combination of random jumps ±Δt√Δt at each infinitesimal interval Δt provides an excellent
            approximation for the continuous random walk limit, producing behavior similar to Brownian motion according
            to the required theoretical principles.</p>
