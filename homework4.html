                    <h2>Statistical Independence</h2>
                    <p>Statistical independence describes situations where the occurrence of one event does not
                        influence the probability of another. This concept is central in analyzing relationships between
                        variables or events.</p>

                    <h3>Formal Definition of Independence</h3>
                    <p>For two events <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> to be <strong>independent</strong>, the probability of both
                        <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> occurring together (denoted as \( P(A \cap B) \)) must equal the product
                        of their individual probabilities:
                    </p>
                    <p class="formula">\[
                        P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)
                        \]</p>
                    <p>If this condition holds, then knowing that <i>A</i> has occurred tells us nothing about the
                        likelihood of <i>B</i>, and vice versa.</p>

                    <h3>Example with Events</h3>
                    <p>Suppose we roll two dice. Let:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>A</strong>: the event that the first die shows a 4.</li>
                        <li><strong>B</strong>: the event that the second die shows a 6.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Since the outcome of one die does not affect the other, these events are independent. The
                        probability of \( A \cap B \) (first die shows 4 and second die shows 6) is:</p>
                    <p class="formula">\[
                        P(A) = \frac{1}{6}, \quad P(B) = \frac{1}{6}, \quad P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B) = \frac{1}{6}
                        \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{36}
                        \]</p>
                    <p>Because \( P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B) \), <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are independent.</p>


                    <h3>Analogy with Conditional Probability</h3>
                    <p>Another way to express independence is through conditional probability: if <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>
                        are independent, then:</p>
                    <p class="formula">\[
                        P(A | B) = P(A) \quad \text{and} \quad P(B | A) = P(B)
                        \]</p>
                    <p>This means that knowing <i>B</i> has occurred does not change the probability of <i>A</i>, and
                        vice versa.</p>

                    <h3>Statistical Independence for Random Variables</h3>
                    <p>Two random variables <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> are independent if, for any values <i>x</i> and
                        <i>y</i>, the probability of \( X = x \) and \( Y = y \) occurring together is the product of
                        their individual probabilities:
                    </p>
                    <p class="formula">\[
                        P(X = x \text{ and } Y = y) = P(X = x) \cdot P(Y = y)
                        \]</p>
                    <p>Example: If <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> represent the results of two independent coin tosses (heads =
                        1, tails = 0), then:</p>
                    <p class="formula">\[
                        P(X = 1 \text{ and } Y = 1) = P(X = 1) \cdot P(Y = 1) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} =
                        \frac{1}{4}
                        \]</p>

        <h2 class="major">Attack Simulation Exercise</h2>
        <h2>Refining the Stochastic SDE Simulator for Continuous Time</h2>
        <p>This task refines the stochastic simulator by transitioning from a discrete random walk process to a
            continuous-time process. This approach approximates the <strong>scaling limit of the random walk</strong>.
            By dividing time into increasingly smaller intervals and applying a probability-based step at each interval,
            we move toward a representation of <strong>Brownian Motion</strong>, or the <em>Wiener Process</em>.</p>

        <h3>1. Continuous Approximation in the SDE Simulation</h3>
        <p>To approximate continuous time, the temporal window is divided into very small intervals, <code>dt</code>,
            that approach zero. At each interval:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>With a probability <code>p</code>, the process takes a step up by <code>+√dt</code>.</li>
            <li>With probability <code>1 - p</code>, it steps down by <code>-√dt</code>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Significance of the Donsker Invariance Principle</h3>
        <p>The <strong>Donsker Invariance Principle</strong>, also known as the <em>Functional Central Limit
                Theorem</em>, underpins why this refinement leads to Brownian Motion. As the time intervals
            <code>dt</code> shrink and the number of steps increases, the discrete random walk (the cumulative sum of
            random steps) converges to a <strong>Wiener Process</strong>. This principle validates that a suitably
            rescaled random walk can approximate continuous Brownian Motion.</p>
        <p>This principle ensures that the discrete model’s <strong>independent increments</strong> and
            <strong>stationary steps</strong> are preserved in the continuous approximation, both of which are essential
            characteristics of Brownian Motion.</p>

        <h3>3. Brownian Motion in the Simulation</h3>
        <p>As the discrete walk becomes continuous, the resulting stochastic process aligns with <strong>Brownian
                Motion</strong>. Key characteristics include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Continuous Paths</strong>: Paths are continuous without jumps, with each position dependent on
                accumulated, infinitesimal, random changes over time.</li>
            <li><strong>Mean and Variance</strong>: The expected change is zero, while variance grows linearly with
                time, similar to a scaled random walk with step sizes adjusted by <code>√dt</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Applications</strong>: Brownian Motion is commonly used in fields such as physics and finance,
                modeling random, continuous behavior over time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Simulation Implications</h3>
        <p>By subdividing the timeline and scaling steps by <code>√dt</code>, the simulator aligns the discrete random
            walk closely with Brownian Motion dynamics. This adaptation not only demonstrates a Brownian path but also
            shows <strong>how the random walk process scales and approximates the properties of Brownian
                Motion</strong>, making it suitable for analyzing systems with random, continuous fluctuations.</p>
        <p>This approach also showcases the simulator’s relevance in modeling <strong>stochastic differential equations
                (SDEs)</strong>, where such approximations are critical for accurately simulating real-world continuous
            processes.</p>
