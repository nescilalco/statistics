                    <h2 class="major">Welford's Recursion</h2>

                    <p>The Welford algorithm is an elegant method for calculating the mean (average) and variance of a
                        dataset incrementally. It avoids the numerical instability that can occur when you calculate the
                        mean and variance in a batch manner (e.g., by summing values first and dividing later).</p>

                    <h2 class="major">Descriptive vs. Inferential Statistics: The Key Difference</h2>

                    <p>Given a sequence of data points \( x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n \), you want to calculate the mean and
                        variance as new data points are added, without needing to store all the previous data points.
                        Welford’s recursion does this efficiently in two steps:
                    </p>

                    <h3>Mean Update</h3>
                    <div class="formula">
                        <p>\( μₙ = μₙ₋₁ + (xₙ - μₙ₋₁) / n \)</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Here, <code>μₙ₋₁</code> is the mean after <code>n-1</code> data points, and <code>xₙ</code> is
                        the new data point. This formula updates the mean with each new value.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Variance Update Formula</h3>
                    <div class="formula">
                        <code>Mₙ = Mₙ₋₁ + (xₙ - μₙ₋₁)(xₙ - μₙ)</code>
                        <br>
                        <code>σ²ₙ = Mₙ / n</code>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The variance is calculated based on the updated mean and sum of squares of differences, where
                        <code>Mₙ</code> is an intermediary variable that accumulates the squared differences from the
                        mean.
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <h2 class="major">Basic Notions</h2>

                    <h3>Population</h3>
                    <p>In statistics, the term "population" refers to the complete set of all possible elements or
                        entities that we are interested in studying. A population could be anything, from all the
                        students in a school to the entire human population of a country or even the total number of
                        cars produced by a company in a year.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If a researcher wants to study the average height of adults in a
                        country, the population would be every adult in that country.</p>
                    <p>Populations are often too large to examine in their entirety, which is why statisticians often
                        take a sample, a smaller subset of the population, to make the study manageable. The goal is to
                        use the sample data to make inferences about the population.</p>

                    <h3>Statistical Units</h3>
                    <p>A statistical unit is any single element or individual from the population that provides data for
                        a study. It’s the basic unit of observation. These units can be people, objects, events, or even
                        measurements depending on the nature of the study.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If we’re looking at the height of adults, each individual adult is a
                        statistical unit. In a study of car performance, each car would be a statistical unit.</p>
                    <p>Statistical units compose the sample, and for this reason they should be clearly defined and
                        measurable to ensure consistency and accuracy in data collection. Well-chosen statistical units
                        help avoid bias and confusion in data interpretation.</p>

                    <h3>Distribution</h3>
                    <p>A distribution describes how the values of a dataset are spread out. It shows the frequency or
                        probability of different outcomes within a dataset. Understanding a distribution allows us to
                        see patterns, outliers, and trends in data.</p>
                    <p>There are many types of distribution:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Normal Distribution:</strong> The classic bell-shaped curve, where most data points
                            are clustered around the mean, with fewer and fewer data points appearing as you move away
                            from the center. This is common in natural phenomena like heights or test scores.</li>
                        <li><strong>Skewed Distribution:</strong> When the data is not symmetrically distributed. For
                            example, a right (positive) skew indicates more data points on the lower end, with a long
                            tail on the higher end.</li>
                        <li><strong>Uniform Distribution:</strong> All outcomes are equally likely, such as rolling a
                            fair die.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Frequency</h3>
                    <p>Frequency gives us a way to see how often certain values or categories appear in a dataset. Here
                        we analyze three key types of frequency: absolute, relative, and percentage.</p>

                    <h5>Absolute Frequency</h5>
                    <p>The absolute frequency is the simplest measure. It’s the number of times a particular value or
                        category appears in a dataset. This is just a straightforward count of occurrences.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Let’s say we’re surveying 100 people about their favorite fruit, and 25
                        people say "apple." The absolute frequency of “apple” is 25 because it was mentioned 25 times.
                    </p>

                    <h5>Relative Frequency</h5>
                    <p>While absolute frequency counts the occurrences, relative frequency tells us how those counts
                        compare to the total number of observations in the dataset. It's expressed as a proportion or
                        fraction of the total.</p>
                    <p><strong>Formula:</strong> Relative Frequency = Absolute Frequency / Total Number of Observations
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> In the fruit survey, if 25 out of 100 people said "apple," the relative
                        frequency would be 25/100 = 0.25. This means 1/4 of the people surveyed chose apples, which
                        provides more context than just knowing 25 people did.</p>

                    <h5>Percentage Frequency</h5>
                    <p>Percentage frequency is simply the relative frequency multiplied by 100, converting the
                        proportion into a percentage. This is one of the most intuitive ways for people to understand
                        frequency, as percentages are commonly used in everyday life.</p>
                    <p><strong>Formula:</strong> Percentage Frequency = Relative Frequency x 100</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Continuing with our fruit survey, the percentage frequency of people
                        who said "apple" would be 25%.</p>
                    <p>$$0.25 \times 100 = 25\%$$</p>

                    <h4>Arithmetic Average</h4>
                    <p>An average is a single number that gives us a general idea of what is typical or representative
                        within a set of values. It’s a measure that summarizes a collection of data, giving us a sense
                        of the "middle" or the "norm."</p>

                    <p>There are many types of average. The "Arithmetic Average" is one of the most used averages to
                        summarise a set of data.</p>

                    <p><strong>Formula:</strong></p>
                    <p>$$\text{avg} = \frac{\sum x_i}{n}$$</p>

                    <p>This is the sum of the values divided by the total number of values.</p>

                    <p>Compared to mode and median, the arithmetic average is easier to compute and interpret, but it's
                        more sensitive to outliers that may distort the result and is not always representative of
                        skewed data.</p>

                    <h2 class="major">Computational Problems with Floating Point Representation</h2>
                    <p>Computers store and manipulate numbers using a system called floating-point representation, which
                        allows them to handle a wide range of numbers despite hardware limitations. It’s called
                        "floating-point" because the decimal (or binary) point "floats" depending on the size of the
                        number being represented. Floating-point numbers are expressed in a scientific notation form,
                        but in base-2 (binary), instead of base-10 (decimal).</p>

                    <p>The number is written as:</p>
                    <p>$$x = s \times m \times 2^e$$</p>

                    <p>Where:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>s</strong> is the sign bit (0 for positive, 1 for negative),</li>
                        <li><strong>m</strong> is the mantissa or significand (which contains the precision of the
                            number),</li>
                        <li><strong>e</strong> is the exponent, determining how large or small the number is by
                            adjusting its scale (the number of powers of 2 to multiply by).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>However, floating-point arithmetic isn’t perfect, and can lead to computational errors:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The mantissa can only store a fixed number of digits, and some numbers cannot be represented
                            exactly, leading to rounding errors. As most floating-point numbers are only approximations,
                            most of the problems arise in long chains of computations, where these small errors can
                            accumulate.</li>
                        <li><strong>Catastrophic cancellation</strong> is a significant loss of precision that occurs
                            when subtracting two nearly equal numbers. The subtraction causes the most significant
                            digits (the leading digits) to cancel out, leaving behind only the smaller and less accurate
                            trailing digits, resulting in a loss of meaningful precision.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The renowned American computer scientist and mathematician Donald Knuth proposed various
                        solutions to these problems in his work "The Art of Computer Programming", among them:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Compensated Summation Techniques:</strong> These techniques involve tracking small
                            errors during summation processes using a compensating variable that accounts for the error
                            in each step of the summation. This helps maintain accuracy in the results.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reformulating Expressions:</strong> This approach aims to find algebraic
                            transformations that reduce or eliminate the need to subtract nearly equal numbers. For
                            example, $$a^2 - b^2$$ can be reformulated as $$(a - b) \times (a + b)$$ to avoid direct
                            subtraction.</li>
                        <li><strong>Using higher precision:</strong> This method consists of using higher precision
                            arithmetic when possible, particularly when dealing with operations that are prone to
                            significant cancellation. For example, switching from single-precision (32-bit) to
                            double-precision (64-bit) or even higher precision can mitigate some of the effects of
                            floating-point errors, though it won't eliminate them entirely.</li>
                    </ul>
